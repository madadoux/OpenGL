and to install openGL 
1. Let’s assume that Visual Studio was installed at the directory “C:\Program File s (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\”.
2. Locate GLFW library files as follows:
 Put glfw3.h inside “C:\ Program File s (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include\gl\” (you may need to create the directory gl yourself).
 Put glfw3.lib inside “C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\lib\”.
 Windows 32-Bit Users: Put glfw3.dll inside “C:\Windows\System32\”.
 Windows 64-Bit Users: Put glfw3.dll inside “C:\Windows\SysWOW64\”.
3. Locate GLEW library files as step 2.
